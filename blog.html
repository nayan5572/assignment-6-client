                <p>
                    var keyword is used to declare variables since JavaScript was created. It is confusing and error-prone when using variables declared using var.

                <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold">Javascript var, let and const variables</h1>
                <p class="text-2xl font-medium mb-6">Block scope</p>
                <p>If you come from a different programming language than Javascript, the following behavior may be
                    surprising to you.</p>
                <p>Unlike in many other languages, variables declared using var keyword do not respect block scope. That
                    means you would expect that variable 'i' from a for loop would be accessible only inside the loop.
                    Wrong. The scope of a variable declared in Javascript depends on where you declare it.
                    If you declare your variable on the root level it is in the global scope. It is actually a variable
                    of the global object (e.g. window).
                    If we take our example with for loop, the variable i is actually now declared also as a property of
                    window - that is window.i!
                    That is terrifying. Function wide scope is usually a lot wider than you need. Often you have
                    variables which only are needed inside of a loop, if statement or similar block. Minimizing the
                    scope where a variable is available is very important. It makes your functions easier to understand
                    and reason about. Most importantly, the smaller the scope is, the smaller is the risk that some code
                    somewhere else will mess with your variables. The bottom line is - it's useful to have smaller
                    encapsulated scopes, rather than a big scope for the whole function. And of course, your functions
                    should be really small anyway, which reduces the scope of the variables within and decreases
                    complexity.

                <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6">Let</h1>
                <p>
                    In ES6 in addition to var, there were two new variable types introduced - let and const. What are
                    they good for if there already is var? One of the differences is that their scope is not the entire
                    function but rather only the enclosing block. That is, some section of code wrapped in curly braces
                    {}. Like the body of an if statement or for loop. Finally, you can minimize the scope of your
                    variables to the bare minimum without ugly workarounds such as IIFE.

                    Another difference (and advantage) of let over var is how hoisting works. Variables declared using
                    var can be accessed in the whole scope (and we already know that var has a bigger scope). You can
                    access them before they are declared. In such case, their value would be undefined though, as only
                    declarations and not initializations are hoisted. This is generally considered a bad practice. Let
                    behaves differently. You can access it only after it was declared. Until then, the variable is
                    considered to be in the 'Temporal Dead Zone'.

                    To better understand the difference between var and let, we need to compare their life cycle. When a
                    scope is entered, the first thing which happens is that the whole scope (function body, block) is
                    searched for variable declarations. Then there is a memory space allocated for each of the
                    variables. After this, the body of the function or block is executed line by line. That's basically
                    how hoisting works and why you can access your variables before declaring them.

                    There is one key difference how this behaves between var and let/const though.

                    In case of var, after creating variable definitions, before executing line by line each of the
                    variables is initialized with the undefined value.
                    In case of let/const, the initialization to undefined does not happen until the line where the
                    declaration actually happens. And only if there is no assignment immediately. On the lines above the
                    variable is in the Temporal Dead Zone and accessing it results in Reference Error.
                    One of the advantages of let over var is also pollution of global scope. When you declare a variable
                    using var on the root level, it is automatically declared on the global object:
                </p>
            </article>
            <article class="mt-8 p-4">
                <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6">Const</h1>
                <p>
                    Const behaves in a very similar way to let. It is also block scoped and cannot be used until
                    declared. There is, however, one key difference. Once variable declared using const keyword is
                    assigned a value, you cannot reassign it. You also need to initialize the variable immediately when
                    declaring it. It is useful as this prevents accidental reassignment of the variable. It also
                    promotes good coding practices as it prohibits using a single variable for multiple purposes during
                    its lifecycle, which is confusing and error-prone. And how can you even have a nice descriptive name
                    of a variable which does multiple different things?

                    While this is a useful concept, you need to be aware of some limitations. The only restriction const
                    provides is about reassignment. That does not mean object assigned to a const variable is not
                    immutable! You can still change its properties, delete them or add new ones. You just cannot assign
                    a completely different object. Note that applies only to objects. In case of primitives such as
                    numbers, strings or booleans, you are safe as they are immutable.

                <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6">Let Vs Const</h1>
                <p>
                    Because of the advantages of const described above, it is a good practice to prefer const over let. Actually, in most of the cases, you can safely use const. There are only a few cases where you really need let. One of the examples can be loops. Because the iterating variable gets changed with every step through the loop you cannot use const. However, you can avoid using loops in many cases in favor of more functional way such as - map, filter or reduce. When using a linter (and you should use it), it can check for you cases where you can safely replace let with const as the variable is never reassigned.
