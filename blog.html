                            <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold">Javascript var, let and const variables</h1>
                            <p class="text-2xl font-medium mb-6">Block scope</p>
                            <p>If you come from a different programming language than Javascript, the following behavior
                                may be
                                surprising to you.</p>
                            <p>Unlike in many other languages, variables declared using var keyword do not respect block
                                scope. That
                                means you would expect that variable 'i' from a for loop would be accessible only inside
                                the loop.
                                Wrong. The scope of a variable declared in Javascript depends on where you declare it.
                                If you declare your variable on the root level it is in the global scope. It is actually
                                a variable
                                of the global object (e.g. window).
                                If we take our example with for loop, the variable i is actually now declared also as a
                                property of
                                window - that is window.i!
                                That is terrifying. Function wide scope is usually a lot wider than you need. Often you
                                have
                                variables which only are needed inside of a loop, if statement or similar block.
                                Minimizing the
                                scope where a variable is available is very important. It makes your functions easier to
                                understand
                                and reason about. Most importantly, the smaller the scope is, the smaller is the risk
                                that some code
                                somewhere else will mess with your variables. The bottom line is - it's useful to have
                                smaller
                                encapsulated scopes, rather than a big scope for the whole function. And of course, your
                                functions
                                should be really small anyway, which reduces the scope of the variables within and
                                decreases
                                complexity.

                                var keyword is used to declare variables since JavaScript was created. It is confusing
                                and
                                error-prone when using variables declared using var.

                            <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6">Let</h1>
                            <p>
                                In ES6 in addition to var, there were two new variable types introduced - let and const.
                                What are
                                they good for if there already is var? One of the differences is that their scope is not
                                the entire
                                function but rather only the enclosing block. That is, some section of code wrapped in
                                curly braces
                                {}. Like the body of an if statement or for loop. Finally, you can minimize the scope of
                                your
                                variables to the bare minimum without ugly workarounds such as FIFE.

                                Another difference (and advantage) of let over var is how hoisting works. Variables
                                declared using
                                var can be accessed in the whole scope (and we already know that var has a bigger
                                scope). You can
                                access them before they are declared. In such case, their value would be undefined
                                though, as only
                                declarations and not initializations are hoisted. This is generally considered a bad
                                practice. Let
                                behaves differently. You can access it only after it was declared. Until then, the
                                variable is
                                considered to be in the 'Temporal Dead Zone'.

                                To better understand the difference between var and let, we need to compare their life
                                cycle. When a
                                scope is entered, the first thing which happens is that the whole scope (function body,
                                block) is
                                searched for variable declarations. Then there is a memory space allocated for each of
                                the
                                variables. After this, the body of the function or block is executed line by line.
                                That's basically
                                how hoisting works and why you can access your variables before declaring them.

                                There is one key difference how this behaves between var and let/const though.

                                In case of var, after creating variable definitions, before executing line by line each
                                of the
                                variables is initialized with the undefined value.
                                In case of let/const, the initialization to undefined does not happen until the line
                                where the
                                declaration actually happens. And only if there is no assignment immediately. On the
                                lines above the
                                variable is in the Temporal Dead Zone and accessing it results in Reference Error.
                                One of the advantages of let over var is also pollution of global scope. When you
                                declare a variable
                                using var on the root level, it is automatically declared on the global object:
                            </p>
                        </article>
                        <article class="mt-8 p-4">
                            <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6">Const</h1>
                            <p>
                                Const behaves in a very similar way to let. It is also block scoped and cannot be used
                                until
                                declared. There is, however, one key difference. Once variable declared using const
                                keyword is
                                assigned a value, you cannot reassign it. You also need to initialize the variable
                                immediately when
                                declaring it. It is useful as this prevents accidental reassignment of the variable. It
                                also
                                promotes good coding practices as it prohibits using a single variable for multiple
                                purposes during
                                its lifecycle, which is confusing and error-prone. And how can you even have a nice
                                descriptive name
                                of a variable which does multiple different things?

                                While this is a useful concept, you need to be aware of some limitations. The only
                                restriction const
                                provides is about reassignment. That does not mean object assigned to a const variable
                                is not
                                immutable! You can still change its properties, delete them or add new ones. You just
                                cannot assign
                                a completely different object. Note that applies only to objects. In case of primitives
                                such as
                                numbers, strings or booleans, you are safe as they are immutable.

                            <p>
                                Because of the advantages of const described above, it is a good practice to prefer
                                const over let.
                                Actually, in most of the cases, you can safely use const. There are only a few cases
                                where you
                                really need let. One of the examples can be loops. Because the iterating variable gets
                                changed with
                                every step through the loop you cannot use const. However, you can avoid using loops in
                                many cases
                                in favor of more functional way such as - map, filter or reduce. When using a linter
                                (and you should
                                use it), it can check for you cases where you can safely replace let with const as the
                                variable is
                                never reassigned.

                    <h1 class="font-semibold text-3xl mt-2">What is Null?</h1>
                    <p>
                        We have heard the word "null" many times in English. Its literal meaning is having no value. The
                        same meaning is analogous to the meaning of null in programming.

                        Null is basically an assignment value given to a variable. The variable which has been assigned
                        as null contains no value.

                        When we assign null as a value to any variable, it means that it is empty or blank. It is to
                        show that the variable has no value. Also, null is an object in JavaScript. When it gets
                        assigned to a variable, it represents no value. The setting of the value must be done manually
                        by the user as JavaScript never sets the value as null. An object can be emptied by setting it
                        to null.
                    </p>
                    <h1 class="font-semibold text-3xl mt-2">What is Undefined?</h1>
                    <p>There is a subtle difference between null and undefined, but as a programmer, it is important
                        that we understand it clearly.

                        As the name suggests, undefined means "not defined". So we declare a variable but do not assign
                        a value to it, the variable becomes undefined.

                        Unlike null, the value of an undefined variable is set by JavaScript as undefined. The variable
                        gets created at the run-time. When we do not pass an argument for a function parameter, the
                        default value is taken as undefined. Besides, when a function doesn't return a value, it returns
                        undefined.</p>

                    <p>
                        The API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of commands, functions, or protocols that
                        act as an intermediary that enables two applications to communicate. It is pretty common to
                        track the delivery guy’s location when you order food from a food delivery application like
                        Zomato. The Google Map API makes it possible for you to do this. Let’s understand API by the
                        analogy of a restaurant. Whenever you visit a restaurant, the waiter helps you place your order.
                        After taking your order, the waiter asks the chef to cook the dish you’d like. When the meal is
                        ready, the waiter brings it to you. A waiter serves as an intermediary between the chef and the
                        customer in this situation. The waiter receives a request (order) from the customer(client),
                        conveys the request to the chef (server), and fetches the prepared dish (response).
